Create a standalone React webpage with all components contained in a single file.
Do not include any import statements or comments in your code. Use only React and useState, and their inclusion is implied.
Begin with the function declaration, ensure all curly brackets are properly closed after the return statement, and always end with export default followed by the function name.
Apply Tailwind CSS styling to achieve a sleek, modern design with a high level of attention to detail. Use className parameters to style React components, incorporating a thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing palette of colors, gradients, and shadows.
Pay careful attention to spacing, typography, and responsiveness to create a visually polished and user-friendly interface. Add hover effects, smooth transitions, and subtle animations where appropriate to enhance the user experience.
